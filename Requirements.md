# Web Development Project for Tum4World Association
The Tum4World association entrusts your team with the task of developing its new website.  
The website consists of a public section and a private section, accessible through authentication with a login and password. All pages are available in Italian.  
The public section contains the following pages:

- **Home Page:** The page includes the following information: a paragraph containing a descriptive text about the association, a logo (which you must create), and an image representative of the association. The page also contains a button that allows downloading an A5 flyer with the main information about the association.
- **Who We Are:** The page contains a more detailed description of the association (for example, when it was founded, by whom, its history, locations, awards received, and so on), accompanied by appropriate images.
- **Activities:** The page provides a brief description of the three activities performed by the association, and a series of images, one for each activity. Clicking on an image leads to a page that describes the corresponding activity in more detail.
- **Activity Page:** The page contains the description of an activity.
- **Contact Us:** The page contains the address, phone number, and a form where users can input their data to be contacted by the association. The form has the following fields: (1) first name and last name, (2) email address, (3) a combo box with contact reasons from which the visitor can choose (if the visitor doesn't find an appropriate reason, they select "other"), (4) a multi-line text box where the visitor can further explain their request, (5) a button to submit the data, (6) a reset button that clears all fields.
- **Submission Confirmed:** The page contains a message confirming the reception of the visitor's message and informing them that a response will be received as soon as possible.
- **Sign-In:** This page is used to register as a supporter or member of the association. The page contains a form with the following fields (all mandatory): (1) first name, (2) last name, (3) date of birth in the format DD/MM/YYYY (if the user is underage, registration will not be allowed), (4) email address, (5) phone number, (6) choice of registering as a supporter or member, (7) choosing a username, (8) choosing a password to be entered twice for confirmation (the password must be at least 8 characters long, contain the first letter of each person's first name, at least one number, one uppercase letter, and a character from $, !, or ?), (9) a button to submit the data, (10) a reset button that clears all fields.
- **Registration Confirmed:** The page contains a message confirming the new user registration.
- **Login:** The page contains a form requesting a username and password.

All pages have a header displaying the association's name and a footer showing the association’s legal address (association name, street, postal code, city, country; the postal code consists of five digits, the first two being the ID of your group, and the last three being zeros). Additionally, the browser tab title is the association's name, accompanied by the logo.

Under the header, all pages contain a horizontal menu allowing users to return to the home page and access the Who We Are, Activities, Contact Us, Sign-In, and Login pages.  
All pages also contain a section presenting inspiring quotes written by the association’s founder. The displayed quote is loaded randomly from a set of quotes available on the server and is updated every twenty seconds. The quote is displayed without reloading the entire page.

A window with information about the use of cookies is shown upon the first access to a public page. For groups with an even ID, the window appears at the bottom left; for odd IDs, the window appears at the bottom right. A strategy should be adopted to manage the case where the user does not accept cookies or has disabled them.

In all pages that contain a form, the data must be validated before being submitted using an appropriate JavaScript script. For the Contact Us page, the only field that must be validated is the email address. When the submit button is pressed on the Contact Us page, an email containing the provided information is sent to an address specified by the site administrator, and the Submission Confirmed page is displayed. When the submit button is pressed on the Sign-In page, the system checks a database for an existing user with the same username. If a user with the same username exists, the Sign-In page is redisplayed with an error message (the message starts with your group’s ID, followed by a colon and the error message). Otherwise, the new user’s data is inserted into the database, and the Registration Confirmed page is displayed.

Upon login, the system checks the database for correctness. If there is an error, the Login page is redisplayed with an error message (starting with the group ID and followed by the error message); otherwise, access to the private section is granted by redirecting the user to the corresponding page based on their status (supporter, member, or administrator). The administrator is pre-registered and can log in with the username "admin" and a password consisting of the group ID concatenated with the string "Adm1n!".

The private section contains the following pages:
- **Supporter:** This page is a dashboard showing the available operations for supporters. Each operation is associated with a button. The operations are as follows: (1) view personal data entered during Sign-In, (2) register for association activities (by clicking on the activity image or via checkboxes), (3) cancel the registration to the site.
- **Member:** The page is organized like the Supporter page, but with an additional operation: making a donation (in Euro) to support the association. This is implemented with a text field to enter an integer amount and a button to submit the donation (the transaction is simulated).
- **Administrator:** This page is a dashboard showing the available operations for the site administrator. Each operation is associated with a button. The operations are as follows: (1) list all registered users, (2) list all supporters, (3) list all members, (4) display the number of site visits and the visit histogram for each page (the administrator may choose to reset the counters), (5) display a graph showing the donations received month by month from January to December of the current year (for months from the current month to December, the donation value will be zero).

In all pages that contain a form, the data must be validated before being submitted using an appropriate JavaScript script. For displaying the visit histogram and donation graph, the server reads the values, writes them to a JSON file, and sends them to the browser, which will handle the display.

The private pages contain a menu organized like the public pages, but with an additional item for logout. A different stylesheet should be used depending on whether the user is an administrator, member, or supporter.

### Requirements:
- Design and develop the website following the MVC pattern, paying particular attention to data persistence management.
- Choose the most appropriate testing tools for your work. Inspired by the chosen tool, design a detailed testing procedure to identify the site’s critical issues and propose solutions to address them (you don’t need to execute the procedure or collect data!). In the annex, include the procedure and proposed solutions with explanations for your choices.
- Produce a description page that explains how the MVC pattern was used. In particular, include a brief description of each software element (e.g., static files, classes, objects) belonging to the Model, View, and Controller. Additionally, you must clearly state: 1) any parts of the project that were not developed, 2) how each student contributed to the project’s development.
